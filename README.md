Description:

This is Messenger App that we have been doing, I decided that I will try to finish it and make it work unlike the last time.

Its simple, you just register a new user, then login. After you login you will be asked to do my ,,captcha" and you are in the menu, where 
you can choose if you want to send message, look at the history of sent messages and see received messages.

Installation:
--
To install, you just import SQL file to MSSQL, create database MessengerApp and execute the SQL file. Then you just start up my project
